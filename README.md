# Incorrect MIME type in <object> tag causing PDF embedding failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error related to the &lt;object&gt; tag and its interaction with the browser's handling of MIME types. Specifically, the issue arises when an incorrect or unsupported MIME type is specified for a PDF file.

## Bug Description
The provided HTML uses the &lt;object&gt; tag to embed a PDF file. However, if the specified `type` attribute is incorrect or if the browser does not support the specified type, the PDF will not be rendered.  This can be due to typos or outdated MIME type specifications.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves verifying the correct MIME type for the PDF file and ensuring the browser supports it. In case of unsupported MIME types, fallback mechanisms (like alternative content) can be implemented.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.  Observe the failure to embed the PDF.
3. Open `bugSolution.html` to see the corrected version.
